Getting Started
===============

Now to get programming. There are actually three things to master here:

#. How to enter a program.
#. How to get it to run.
#. How to find the results.

It has been said [#KnR]_ that once a new programmer can do these three things, the rest is compararively easy!

Remember that a program is just a text file. So you need to be able to create that file using your editor or IDE. And you need to store the file *somewhere where you will be able to find it again*. (That might seem obvious, but it often gets forgotten.

One way to learn some programming is simply to enter some programs, and run then [#Speccy]_. Gradually you come to understand what all the commands do. So let's start with three short programs, and try that.

Three Programs
==============

Here are three programs. Enter them into your computer (make sure you know where they're stored!), and then run them in whatever's the most convenient way.

.. index:: single: Programs; hello.py - the first program
.. literalinclude:: /../../src/03/hello.py
   :language: python
   :caption: ``hello.py``

.. literalinclude:: /../../src/03/hello_name.py
   :language: python
   :caption: ``hello_name.py``


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#KnR] It is said in *The C Programming Language* by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Richie, a book affectionately known as "K&R".
.. [#Speccy] Most programmers between the ages of, say, 50 and 60 learned programming this way, hacking away at programs on the home microcomputers of the 1980s. ZX Spectrum all the way.
