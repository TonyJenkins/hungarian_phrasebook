This book was produced using the `Sphinx Documentation Generator <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_. This in turn uses a bunch of other Python packages that have all been made available by their developers. The theme is Sphinx `{book theme} <https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/>`_.

The main font in the PDf version is ``Bitter``. Some text is in ``Lato``. The code samples are in ``Cascadia Code``.

The whole thing was cobbled together with PyCharm, with Git and GitHub keeping track of things.
