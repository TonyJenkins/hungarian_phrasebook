Keeping it Simple
=================

Right at the start of the book we went through some basic ideas that, together, formed what you need to know to start programming. If you look back, you will see that we have now covered everything. Sure, there are some things that will make our programming lives easier, and some features of Python that need a mention, but everything is very much there.

We could use what we have learned to write complex programs. But there would be a problem. These programs would quickly become very long, and the whole process would be unsustainable. How would we cope if a small change in a program at line 11 caused an expected error at line 276? Or even line 102982? Complex systems are made up of tens of thousands of lines of program code, often more. No-one can cope with that complexity, so there needs to be some way to keep the day-to-day programming tasks to something we can comprehend.
