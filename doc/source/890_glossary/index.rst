    Artificial Intelligence

        The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

        And, to be honest, writing glossary entries.

    Compiled Language

        A programming language that requires its source code is converted into an executable form, using a compiler, before it can be run. For example, C.

    Interactive Development Environment (IDE)

        A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.
        An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. A Python IDE will normally have features specific to Python, such as easy access to the Python interpreter.

    Interpreted Language

        A programming language where statements are interpreted one at a time and executed as the program runs. For example, Python. Also Ruby, or Perl.

    Interpreter

        A program that reads and executes code. Python is an interpreted language, so the Python interpreter reads and executes Python code.
